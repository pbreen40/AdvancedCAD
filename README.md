# AdvancedCAD
## My AdvancedCAD assignments

### Gearbox:
#### Objective
Create a box that holds four gears which are controlled by a knob.
#### Lesson
I learned  how to use configurations, gear mating, and Global Variables. Configurations use global variables, which allow you to have the same design with different dimensions and features. Gear mates are a special type of mate designed for gears.

#### Components:
##### Root_gear
The original gear that uses configurations.
##### Axel
Holds the gears in place.
##### Knob
Used to spin the gears.
##### Plate
Front and back sides. 
##### Spacer
Used to keep the gears from hitting the plates.


### MotionStudy:
#### Objective
Learn and explore motion study.
#### Lesson
During this assignments I learned how to use Motion Studies and Slot Mates. Motion Studies are like little animations you can make to demonstrate how parts will react in real environments. In our motion study, that took the place of a servo moving a shelf will operating under different directions of gravity (In real life, parts will sometimes be on their sides and in rare cases will even hang upside down). Slot mates are useful mechanical mates that will stop a circular object from leaving a slot. Just select the slot end and a circle, and it will not be able to leave it.

#### Components:
##### Base
The base that held all the parts together
##### Bracket
The bracket that held the clip in place
##### Clip
The little piece that connected the shelf to the bracket
##### ServoArm
The servo arm that connects to the servo and pushes the shelf up and down
##### ServoMount
The servo mount that held the servo in place
##### Shelf
The shelf that was pushed up and down by the servo


### StressAnalysis
#### Objective
Create a part to understand how Stress Analysis works
#### Lesson
During this assgnment I learned how to use Stress Analyses and Silhouette. Stress Analysis is a program that will simulate real world stress on a object and will tell you if the force is great enough to break the part. In our Stress Anlysis we had to modify a part until it was strong enough to not break under a specified force (For this simulation it was 4000 N). Silhouette is a feature that will add a break (a line) in a other wise smooth face. To use it, select the face you want to break, and the plan that will break it.
